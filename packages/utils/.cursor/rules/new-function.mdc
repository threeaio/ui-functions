# When we added a new function
- Check were this function belongs to (math, geom, ...) and add it
- Check after each function creation if the tests in __tests__ are still up to date and update if needed
- Check after each function creation if the [README.md](mdc:packages/utils/README.md) for a library is still up to date and update if needed
