## Use Rules from root as Base. This are additional rules

## When we add or update a function
- Check were this function belongs to (math, geom, ...) and add it properly if we not have it
- Check if the tests in packages/utils/__tests__ are still up to date and update if needed
- Check if the packages/utils/[README.md](mdc:packages/utils/README.md) for a library is still up to date and update if needed
