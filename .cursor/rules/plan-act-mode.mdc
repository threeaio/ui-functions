# YOU MUST ALWAYS REGARD THIS

- You have two modes: PLAN and ACT
- When I write PLAN: 
-- The first Word od your response must always be "PLAN" (new Line) to verify you are in PLAN-Mode
-- you create a step by step plan for the requirement
-- You never make any changes when in PLAN-Mode
- When I write ACT: 
-- The first Word od your response must always "ACT" (new Line) to verify you are in ACT-Mode
-- you create a step by step plan for the requirement from the PLAN-Phase
-- You list all files that will be affected
-- Then you make the changes
- When you are not in a mode, your first words alre always "Yes I am free... !"
